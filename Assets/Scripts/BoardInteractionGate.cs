/// Single owner of "is the board interactive right now?".
///
/// Every piece of board hover feedback — minion range, passive tooltips, the info card, push arrows,
/// death previews — is delivered by Unity's LEGACY mouse messages (OnMouseEnter/OnMouseExit on a
/// Collider2D). Those are dispatched against physics colliders and never consult the EventSystem, so
/// UI drawn on top cannot block them: opening the card selection panel over the board still lets the
/// minions underneath light their range squares. That was a deliberate trade (see the comment on
/// <see cref="HeroPassiveIndicator"/>: CardPlayArea is a screen-space OVERLAY raycast target covering
/// the board, so an EventSystem pointer would never reach world-space objects at all), and this class
/// is what pays for it.
///
/// Enforcement is <see cref="Camera.eventMask"/>, which gates Unity's delivery of ALL legacy OnMouse*
/// messages in one property. Deliberately a layer BELOW the hover code: every previous attempt at this
/// put a guard inside each OnMouseEnter, and they drifted apart immediately (MinionController checks
/// EndGame and AnyCardDragging, HeroPassiveIndicator checks nothing at all). A hover source cannot opt
/// out of this gate by forgetting a check, and hover code written later is covered without knowing the
/// gate exists.
///
/// Two things it deliberately does NOT touch:
///   - EventSystem/uGUI hover. The selection panel's own option cards (CardHoverOutline) keep swelling
///     and stay clickable while the board goes quiet, which is exactly the point.
///   - Right-click cancel. GameManager.Update reads Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1) directly, so backing
///     out of a card play still works while the board is gated.
///
/// There is deliberately NO cleanup pass for feedback that was already on screen when the gate closed,
/// and it should not be added back. Masking the camera makes Unity's mouse raycast miss, and Unity then
/// delivers OnMouseExit to whatever was hovered exactly as if the pointer had left — VERIFIED in play
/// mode: a minion's range squares go dark the instant the mask drops, with the mouse held still on the
/// minion. Every hover source therefore cleans up through its own existing exit handler. A central
/// "hide everything" method would have to name each source, which is the very drift this class exists
/// to remove.
///
/// Self-installing, so it needs no scene or prefab wiring (same reasoning as CardSelectionPanel's
/// static bootstrap).
