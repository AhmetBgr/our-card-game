/// The rewards panel of a won Forged in Battle battle: the list of what the battle paid out, opened beside
/// the end-of-match panel (<see cref="PopupManager.OpenGameOverPopup"/>), the way Slay the Spire hands out
/// a fight's rewards before the map comes back. It sits under that panel in the hierarchy, so it scales
/// in and out with it. Its Proceed replaces the end-of-match one.
///
/// It lists two kinds of reward, one row each:
///   * the new cards a win is worth (<see cref="GauntletRun.PendingBattleReward"/>): the row runs the
///     picks it owes one at a time through the match's own <see cref="CardSelectionPanel"/>, by way of
///     <see cref="CardChoice"/>, so a reward pick looks exactly like an in-match Discover. The panel
///     hides itself while the options are up and comes back between picks;
///   * every milestone the battle's XP just reached: the row is added the moment the track under the
///     end-of-match panel fills up to it (<see cref="BattleXpTrack.XpShown"/>), and claims it. Instant
///     rewards apply on the spot and the row says what they did, an
///     Upgraded Cards milestone runs its picks like the card row, and a New Perk milestone opens its
///     options in the <see cref="PerkSelectionPanel"/>, just as a card row opens the card panel.
///
/// The battle's score is credited here rather than on the way out (<see cref="GauntletRun.CollectScore"/>),
/// so the milestones the win reaches are already reached by the time the rows are built.
///
/// Rewards are not skippable: Proceed stays locked until nothing is owed, then leaves for the Draft scene
/// (<see cref="GauntletRun.LeaveBattle"/>), which is what the end-of-match Proceed did before this panel
/// existed. The panel GameObject is authored DISABLED, like CardSelectionPanel, so it is resolved lazily
/// through <see cref="Resolve"/> rather than cached from Awake.
