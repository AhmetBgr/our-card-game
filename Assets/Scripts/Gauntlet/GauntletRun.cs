/// loads between the Draft and Game scenes, like <see cref="MatchModifiers"/>.
///
/// The run is saved (<see cref="GauntletSaveStore"/>) after every change to it, so quitting at any point
/// -- the draft, mid-battle, the end-of-match rewards -- resumes there (<see cref="TryResume"/>). Every
/// roll comes from the run's own seeded stream (<see cref="RunRandom"/>), every enemy is rolled up front
/// when the hero is picked, and every rolled option is saved as rolled, so a resume never rerolls
/// anything. A battle walked out of restarts against the same enemy, with the same opening shuffle.
///
/// Gameplay asks it three things, all no-ops while no run is active: which hero and deck each side
/// plays with (<see cref="HeroFor"/>, <see cref="DeckFor"/>, read in Agent.ApplySavedSelection), how to
/// adjust the heroes at match setup (<see cref="ApplyEnemySetup"/>, <see cref="RestorePlayerHero"/>),
/// and what to do with the result (<see cref="OnBattleWon"/>, <see cref="OnBattleLost"/>).
///
/// Later enemies are rolled with blessings (<see cref="GauntletBlessing"/>), which GameManager reads
/// through the same kind of no-op-outside-a-run hooks: <see cref="OwnPassivesFor"/>,
/// <see cref="ExtraPassivesFor"/>, <see cref="StartingManaFor"/>, <see cref="ExtraStartingCardsFor"/>
/// and <see cref="SummonStartingMinion"/>.
///
/// Each won battle's end-of-match score is added to the run's <see cref="Xp"/>, which reaches the
/// milestones of the progression track (<see cref="Milestones"/>): one every
/// <see cref="GauntletConfigSO.milestoneXpStep"/> XP, then a final one at
/// <see cref="GauntletConfigSO.finalMilestoneXp"/> rolled from its own pool. The track unlocks after the first win; reached
/// milestones are claimed with <see cref="ClaimMilestone"/>, and must all be claimed before the next
