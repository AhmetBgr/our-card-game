/// The component stays on the hero (HeroPassiveSystem and GameManager both reach it via For(hero)),

/// every lunge, punch and death animation.

/// spot at <see cref="slotSpacing"/>.

/// It reads runtime.passives rather than HeroSO directly, so it can never disagree with what the
/// system actually registered.
